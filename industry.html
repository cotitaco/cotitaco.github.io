                      permission from the owner of the system to allow the bots to enter and look for 
                      information as if it was a user. So, my team and I needed to ensure the bot complied

                      This area was in charge of validating that all technological projects use the optimal 
                      combination of technologies and systems. My job here was to record each project and 
                      help project managers deal with deadlines. I programmed a series of automated emails

                      This project was my first baby. It started with a POC and me acting as a Business 
                      Analyst, understanding its needs. The project involved analyzing Excel files and 
                      passing them to an HDFS platform in Hadoop. Once there, they were used to feed a 
                      Random Forest every six months to create a model capable of predicting which clients 
                      who were initially rejected for getting a personal loan should be reconsidered for a 
                      smaller loan. This project was done using Python and Cloudera.

                      My role in this project was as a Business Analyst to understand our client's needs. 
                      Then, as a programmer, I prepare the data for extraction, variable selection, 
                      feature engineering and model training. My final role was as the Tech Lead to load 
                      the solution into a productive server.

                      The purpose of this project was to use a Machine Learning model to classify different 
                      geographical locations within Mexico City based on the number of businesses that are 
                      around to better plan opening or closing a branch office or ATM locations. For this 
                      project, we used Autosys, Python, and Cloudera tools such as HUE and Tableau.

                      This project was my second baby. When I got there, the model was already created, 
                      but I had to optimize the code, as it took more than 7 hours to run. Also, ensure 
                      the ingested data meets all the security standards for being stored in a safe 
                      database. Also, I was in charge as Tech Lead to organize the correct 
                      communication with Tableau for showing results and preparing the productive server to 
                      store raw and processed data together with the algorithm safely.

                      This project decreased the risk of an EUC (a manual process). It gathered information 
                      from different Excel files and concatenated them into a single file. Then stored 
                      it inside a secure database to be consumed by the users. My role in this project was 
                      to automate using Automation Anywhere the merging process. After the project was done, 
                      it was my responsibility to train over 300 users all around the country. So, I did a 
                      series of video tutorials with examples and the most relevant information on 
                      interacting with the bot.
