          Effort and Time Estimation on Agile Technonoly Projects using Transformer-Based Models
        </h1>

        <h2 class="sub">Role</h2>
        <h4 class="desc">
          For this project, I was part of a team of two people and for the lecture "CSI5137C: 
          Applications of NLP and ML in Software Engineering" We decided to make use of a Large 
          Language Model to tackle a real-life problem. 
        </h4>

        <h2 class="sub">Problem</h2>
        <h4 class="desc">
          In the technology sector, a team should have a structured way to plan and develop a project 
          , and there are different ways to do this depending on the team, the company and the type and 
          size of the project. For some years, Agile and Scrum have gained popularity due to their 
          efficiency and structure in developing and deploying production technology and software-based 
          project. Now, this does not mean that Agile is the best solution for all projects, but in 
          some cases, teams can obtain benefits if the structure is correctly followed.
        </h4>

        <h4 class="desc">
          One disadvantage of working in an Agile project is all the politics it has. For example, 
          before the project starts or before each "sprint" (or chunk of the project) begins, the 
          whole team has to propose and approve the "user stories," which are a quick and accurate 
          description of the client's need. And also assign "story points" to each user story. A 
          story point is a metric based on the Fibonacci sequence, which describes how much effort 
          that specific task will require. This number is completely subjective, but it gives 
          the team a good base to calculate how long the project will take and how to split 
          certain tasks.
        </h4>

        <h4 class="desc">
          As you can imagine, writing down and assigning a value to each user story is a tedious task 
          normally assigned to the development team. Which apart from planning, developing and 
          sometimes even doing production support, it has to waste its time on this step. To avoid this 
          time-consuming task, some researchers have been investing some time in feeding deep learning 
          models with the descriptions of the tasks or user stories and then training Natural Language
          Processing models to try to estimate the amount of time they will require and also the 
          number of story points it will also require. This is a complex task, as the technical 
          language of each company is unique, and the complex words used in the software development 
          world are difficult to interpret. In the past, some researchers have been using deep 
          learning models such as Long Short Term Memory models LSTM and achieving a decent 
          accuracy.
        </h4>

        
        <h2 class="sub"> Solution</h2>

        <h4 class="desc">
          For this lecture, we proposed the use of transformers and, most importantly, the use of both 
          BERT and DistilBERT to try to synthesize the features from the text and create an accurate 
          model capable of understanding the context of the sentences which describe the tasks 
          in a project, predict how much effort this task will require. 
        </h4>

        <h4 class="desc">
          For our project, we found a vast dataset which contains several essential features, such as 
          the user story, the title of the user story and the amount of story points. The good thing 
          about this dataset is that it is divided into several CSV files, each containing the 
          user stories of specific projects. This allowed the original authors to analyze the 
          performance of the models by category. In our case, this was unnecessary, so you will 
          find a merged CSV file within my repository. The image below shows an example of one of the 
          files.
        </h4>

        <img src="Images/Story1.png" style="max-width:70%;" class=" bannerImg p-0 m-0">

        <h4 class="desc">
          Before training the models, we had two baselines: the first one is a Gaussian guesser
          , and the second one was a Zero Rule, which predicts everything as the class with the most significant 
          number of elements. In the graph below, you can see the F1 score of BERT's fine-tuning process.
        </h4>

        <h4 class="desc">
          Last but not least here is a compartive table of the accuracy obtained from our base lines 
          and the fine-tuned BERT.
